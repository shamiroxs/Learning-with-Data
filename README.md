# Learning-with-Data
A collection of projects and exercises focused on learning data analysis techniques, tools, and concepts. This repository tracks my journey as I build foundational skills in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical methods.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning process, practice new skills, and experiment with different data analysis techniques. Each project is an opportunity to understand key concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios.

## Contents

This repository includes:

1. **Basic Data Analysis Projects**: Simple projects focusing on fundamental concepts.
2. **Python and Pandas Exercises**: Learning to manipulate data using Python.
3. **SQL Practice**: Developing skills in database management and query writing.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Projects focused on understanding and visualizing data.

## Learning Outcomes

These projects are meant to solidify my understanding of data analysis tools and techniques, while also preparing me for more advanced topics in the future.

## Acknowledgments

This repository was inspired by various online courses, tutorials, and personal curiosity.
